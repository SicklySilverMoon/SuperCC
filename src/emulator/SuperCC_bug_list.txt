SuperCC bug list:

Priority: *Should* be fixed now
1. TWS reading sometimes desyncs for TWSes with mouse moves, resulting in moves after the mouse move being offset by [1/2]
(desyncs a lot of mouse routes)

Priority: Low
2. Block/Block results in a block being flicked. Intended behavior: treated as Block/Floor, erasing the lower block when pushed, except when the attempted push is out of a teleport, which results in flicking the top block off of the lower block.

Priority: Low
3. Block/Clone Machine should clone a block in the pushed direction.

Priority: Medium
4. When teleporting, Chip should try each teleport move in turn until finding one that isn't blocked or returning to the first teleport, bouncing off of it like it's ice. This should flick any blocks on acting walls on those tiles. This should not reveal blue walls/hidden walls blocking teleports.

Priority: Very Low
5. Add TSG tick into exit to save 0.1

Priority: Cosmetic
6. Invalid tiles don't always show- Floor/Thin Wall shows no indication that a tile is buried there, among others.

Mouse issues:

Mouse bug 1 (Fixed):
If a mouse move is made via boosting so it occurs on the first half of the turn it doesn't add a half wait after the move like it should and allows for an erroneous extra move that turn
(cclp4 68, down then up then click up left of Chip, should add a half wait after but doesn't)

Mouse bug 2 (Not a bug, intended behaviour under MSCC):
Currently: second mouse move cancels first mouse move
What should happen: first move executes, the second move the next turn unless canceled by something within that next turn
