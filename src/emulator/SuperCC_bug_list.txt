SuperCC bug list:

"the intended solution of level 63 involves bouncing the block off the chip at (19,23) back through the trap at (19,21). If this solution is loaded into SuperCC, the block gets removed from the sliplist on re-entering the trap when it should remain on the sliplist, thus the solution does not play back."

TSG is just broken to all hell
